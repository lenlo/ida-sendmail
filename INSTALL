INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

These instructions will tell you step-by-step how to install and bring
the Kit's sendmail system up.  The source code modifications are given
as context diffs, based on the BSD 4.3 release of sendmail version 5.59,
ready to be installed using Larry Wall's eminent patch program.  You
will also need the latest version of BIND (4.8) to compile and link
sendmail with MX support.  The option of using Maryland's mdbm library
is still open, although it has not been tested with this version of
sendmail.  Finally, in order to automatically produce routing tables,
you will need Peter Honeyman's pathalias program.  Both of the latter
are available from your nearest USENET comp.sources.unix archive.

 [1] Unpack the Kit in the sendmail directory (preferably).  This should
     give you a new ida subdirectory with all the Kit's files.  (Hmm,
     perhaps you've already done this since you are reading this file.)

 [2] Goto sendmail/ida and check that you agree with the Makefile's
     definitions.  If you change anything, do a "make configure" to
     propagate those changes to the subdirectories' Makefiles.

 [3] Goto sendmail/ida/doc.  Do "make doc" to print out the accompanying
     paper and "make man" to print the manual pages.  Do "make install"
     to install the latter in your man directory.

 [4] Goto sendmail/ida/patches and do "make backup".  This will create a
     backup copy of sendmail/src/*.[hc] and sendmail/doc/op.me in
     Backup.tar.  You can restore them if necessary by performing "make
     restore", still in the patches directory.

 [5] Do "make patch" to install the IDA enhancements.  You will need
     patch(1), for this or else edit the files by hand.  Look out for
     rejected patches; that will indicate that you aren't patching the
     generic sendmail 5.59.

 [6] Goto sendmail/src and recompile sendmail.  You'll need to do a
     "make depend" before you can do "make".  See that it still works.
     Your old configuration file should still work unless you depend on
     some obscure side effects.

 [7] Goto sendmail/ida/aux and do "make" to compile the auxiliary
     programs.  Try them out, guided with the newly printed manual
     pages.

 [8] Do "make install" to install the programs in BINDIR (/usr/local/bin
     by default; but another choice would be /usr/lib/mail if you only
     intend to use them with this kit).  It's also about time to
     (manually) create a symbolic link from /usr/ucb/bsmtp to
     /usr/lib/sendmail if you intend to receive batched SMTP mail.

 [9] Goto sendmail/ida/cf and inspect the supplied m4(1) configuration
     definitions.  Send Sendmail.mc to your line printer and study it.
     Do "make" to see how the sample configurations look expanded.

[10] Goto sendmail/ida/lib and inspect the supplied sample data files.
     Try applying the xalparse program on the xaliases file if you feel
     like it.

[11] Determine your site's routing capabilities and create your corre-
     sponding data files in LIBDIR.  Go back to sendmail/ida/cf and
     create your own m4(1) configuration file using the samples as
     templates.  Produce an actual, personal sendmail.cf file.

[12] Try out your new sendmail system.
     Good Luck!
