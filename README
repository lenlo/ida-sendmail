	    Welcome to The IDA Sendmail Enhancement Kit.


This Kit includes a set of source code modifications to the BSD 4.3
sendmail program (version 5.59), which will enable it to have direct
access to dbm(3) files, separate envelope/header rewritings, multi-token
class matches, and many other things.  Also included is the IDA Sendmail
Master Configuration file and a sample setup used at the CIS Dept, U of
Linkoping.  The configuration file together with the supplied data files
and utility programs, implement such nice features as pathalias based
systems routing within sendmail, fully !-/@-translating rulesets, and
generic local user addresses.

The new sendmail functions are breifly listed below and further
described in the accompanying paper, which also discusses electronic
mail addressing in general and hybrid addresses in particular.  (The
numbers to the right indicate in what section of the paper they are
described.)

   Direct Access to Dbm(3) Files............................. 7.2

If you are reading this without actually having a copy of the kit, look
for it in your nearest comp.sources.unix archive or use anonymous ftp to
fetch a compressed tape archive from arisia.xerox.com in ftp1/ida.tar.Z.

Read more in INSTALL about how to get it all together.  Send bug reports
and dito fixes to the author, but please note he (and his employer) may
believe that there is more in life than maintaining everybody else's
mail systems.  Also note that this is an unsupported package as far as
the University of Linkoping and Rank Xerox Ltd are concerend -- so do
not go to your local Xerox Copy Center and complain about the rewriting
rules.  Remember: you got it for free => you can't get your money back.

Enjoy!

======================================================================
Addendum for the 2nd release (1.1) of the IDA Sendmail Enhancement Kit
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 1.1 of the Kit has been upgraded to work with Sun's ported
version of sendmail (5.58).  Only minor changes has been made to
sendmail.h.diff and srvrsmtp.c.diff in order to patch the new source
correctly, but queue.c.diff was removed entirely since that bug now
should be fixed in the BSD release -- subsequently, you should ignore
section 7.14 of the IDA Kit documentation.  Expect some of the patches
to install with a minor offset reported by patch -- they have not been
changed since 1.0 but should still be correct.


======================================================================
Addendum for the 3rd release (1.2) of the IDA Sendmail Enhancement Kit
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A complete new set of patches has been made for this release, which
applies to sendmail 5.59 with MX.  For this, the BSD4.2 and BSD2.9
compatibility code has been removed but it will still compile on Suns
with SunOS 3.x or greater.  A new addition is the support for Sun's
Yellow Pages in the dbm routines--if the name of a database you specify
begins with a percent sign, eg:

	OKP%pathtable

then lookups to that database will be handled by YP instead of a local
dbm file.  See example in lib/Makefile on how to set up a shared
pathalias database for a local area network.

Furthermore, the code that searches dbm files has been changed to
automatically notice if a database has been changed and to reinitialize
itself accordingly.  Also, both sendmail and dbm(1) has been modified to
use file locking when updating local dbm files.  This won't help for
shared nfs file systems, though--use YP instead.

The syntax for set (class) declarations has been extended to allow
programs as well as files to define a set.  If a file name in an F
statement begins with a vertical bar, as in:

	FU|uuname

it is assumed to be followed by the name of a program, which will
produce the set's members on its standard output.  Scanf formats are
allowed as usual.

A set of patches received from gamiddleton@waterloo has been included in
this release:

$&x -- Delayed macro evaluation [from gatech?]

	This macro is used in the config file to delay interpretation
	until run-time.  A typical application would be to delay
	evaluation of the 'r' macro, which is usually passed to sendmail
	by other programs to define the sending protocol; e.g. rmail
	does:
		sendmail -oMrUUCP ...
	If you don't use $&r and then freeze the configuration file,
	you'll get the value of $r at "freezing" time instead of
	"thawing" time.  Note that this only applies to RHS expressions
	in rules; use $r elsewhere.

$!x -- RFC822 quoted macro expansion

	Used to keep address legal wrt RFC822 when constructing the
	From: line for a local user.  The macro is expanded as usual,
	but if any character in it is illegal, the whole string gets
	quoted.  Eg, with:
		Dq$?x$!x $.<$g>
	an address like 'Joe User @ Waterloo <juser@waterloo.edu>'
	would be rewritten as '"Joe User @ Waterloo" <juser@waterloo.edu>'
	to make it legal.

Address rewriting loop detection

	We found address rewriting was looping if the sendmail.cf file
	was slightly wrong; this code keeps sendmail from looping forever.

An extra compile-time frozen file check

	The date of the frozen configuration file is compared to the
	time sendmail itself was compiled.  If the .fc file is older, it
	is ignored and the .cf file is used instead.


Be aware that you will need the latest version (4.8) of BIND in order to
compile sendmail 5.59 with MX support.  If you don't want to install its
include and library files in the system directories, add an additional
-I{bind}/include to CFLAGS in sendmail/src/Makefile and -L{bind}/res in
front of the LIBS variable ({bind} = location of bind directory).

Sun users: Make sure that your syslog.o {in /lib/libc.a} has been
compiled with the BSD4.3 netdb.h if you want to use the LOG option.
Also note that sendmail compiled with bind's resolver won't use the
Yellow Pages host table at all.  For your convenience, a compressed
binary copy of IDA sendmail for Sun-3 is available in
~ftp/pub1/ida-sendmail-sun3.Z on Arisia.Xerox.COM via anonymous ftp.


Note for BIND experts
---------------------
One of the changes I made to the code was to use the gethostbyname()
that BIND's resolver supplies instead of the internal getcanonname()
that does repeated res_searches for CNAME records.  This was because I
needed both an acknowledgement of the domain's existance as well as its
fully qualified name (eg. foo.bar => foo.bar.edu), of which the old code
supported neither.  But this now means that there has to be an IN A
(Internet address) record for the domain name we wish to canonicalize.
Another possible option could have been to modify getcanonname() to do
wildcard lookups, but I'm not convinced that's the right way to go.  On
the other hand, I'm no name server wizard, so if you think I'm wrong,
please let me know why (and how) and I'll change it.


Bugs
----
 o  There is currently no equivalent of $[...$] for MX records, so the
    IDA Sendmail.mc file will always use any available pathalias routing
    before defaulting to MX/TCP.
 o  When a name server responds with an athoritive "host not found",
    there is currently no way of finding out who is responsible for this
    information -- we'll need to do our own NS lookups to do so.
 o  It has been reported that a syserr of "net timeout" {in util.c} may
    cause sendmail to exit ungracefully without removing the lock file
    and without making a note of which recipients the message already
    has been delivered to.


Minor Revisions
---------------
1.2.1 - Various changes to Sendmail.mc regarding its interpretation of
	hybrid addresses; made to parse according to receiving protocol.
	(Reimplemented BANGIMPLIESUUCP;	obsoleted UUCPPRECEDENCE; added
	STRICTLY822, UUCPMAILER.)
1.2.2 -	Made database lookups NOT send result through sprintf if there
	was no sprintf arg in call, ie. $(X foo $) or $(X foo $: bar $).
	This will make it less error-prone for usage with non-pathalias
	databases.  Note, however, that from this version of IDA, double
	percent signs will NOT be reduced to single percents (ie, you may
	need to update your databases if you had adjusted for this before).
1.2.3 - Split the TCP mailer into TCP and TCP-D (DECnet gateway); added
	a TCP-U mailer and ruleset 13 for UUCP gateways that require
	hybrid addresses, ie. UUCP !-paths on top of @-domains (brr).
	Made sure the h macro (remote host) is defined in buildaddr()
	before the mailer rulesets are called.  Added TCPMAILER option.
1.2.4 - Sendmail.mc: A list of well-known pseudo-domains (PSEUDODDOMAINS) 
	has been added to reduce load on the root name server by
	avoiding name server lookups on domains ending in these.
1.2.5 - Sendmail.mc: Experimental support for XNS Mail (XNSMAIL, XNSDOMAIN).
	Improved the error reporting code in usersmtp.c to mention what
	host it was talking to when the error occurred.  Also made
	deliver.c tell a little more about "host unknown" errors.
