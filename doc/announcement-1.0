The IDA Sendmail Enhancement Kit was finally sent off to Rich Salz of
comp.sources.unix today.  He still has problems receiving sources for
the newsgroup after his relocation, but I'm afraid I couldn't wait any
longer.  At the end of this week, I'm off for a new job in another
country.  I hope it won't take too long for the Kit to appear in the
newsgroup.  For those of you who have ARPANET access and don't want to
wait, thanks to Dorab Patel of UCLA there is a copy on the host
ulysses.cs.ucla.edu [128.97.2.19] in the file ~ftp/pub/ida.tar.Z
available for anonymous FTP.  If anyone is really desperate, I can
probably send copy by mail too (330 Kbyte in 7 shars).  But you will
have to react quickly then...

The Kit includes a set of source code modifications to the BSD 4.3
sendmail program (version 5.11).  The changes will enable sendmail to
have direct access to dbm(3) files, separate envelope/header rewriting
rulesets, and multi-token class matches among other things.

As a separate part of the Kit is the IDA Sendmail Master Configuration
file and a sample setup used at the CIS Dept, U of Linkoping.  The
configuration file together with the supplied data files and utility
programs, implement such nice features as pathalias based systems
routing within sendmail, fully !-/@-translating rulesets, and generic
local user addresses.

The new sendmail functions are breifly listed below and further
described in the accompanying paper, which in addition discusses
electronic mail addressing in general and hybrid addresses in
particular.

   Nameserver Default Argument
   Direct Access to Dbm(3) Files
   Batched SMTP Support
   Separate Envelope/Header Rewriting Rulesets
   Separate Local UUCP Host Name
   Return Path for UUCP Mailers
   UUCP Header Address Relativization
   Support for Multi-Token Matches
   Support for Embedded Subruleset Calls
   Elaborate Matching Algorithm for Unknown Local Recipients
   Support for Maryland's Mdbm Package
   Improved Test Mode Output
   Better To: and Cc: Headers of Returned Messages
   Queue Bug Fixed
   Shared Input SMTP Bug Tentatively Fixed
   Optional BSD 2.9 and 4.2 Compatibility Code
 & Miscellaneous Changes

Enjoy!
