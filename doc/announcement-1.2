Gentlemen and -women, it does indeed exist!

Please welcome the IDA Sendmail Enhancement Kit v1.2 for sendmail 5.59
with MX and Yellow Pages support.  It has tonight been made available on
Arisia.Xerox.COM in ~ftp/pub1/ida.tar.Z (available via anonymous ftp)
and will be sent to comp.sources.unix shortly.

The major change is that of Yellow Pages support, but others include dbm
file update locking, setting classes from programs (eg. FU|uuname),
delayed macro evaluation (from the net), rfc822 quoted macro expansion,
address rewriting loop detection and an extra compile-time frozen file
check; the latter ones contributed by Guy Middleton @ Waterloo.

There has also been some bug fixes and slight improvements on the IDA
configuration file and associated files.

All the old enhancements still apply, with the exception of BSD2.9 and
4.2 support, although it will compile and run under SunOS 3.x given that
you have bind 4.8 as well.

For those of you who haven't heard of this before, the IDA Enhancement
Kit is a set of changes to the standard Berkeley mailer which implements
the following features:

  o  Nameserver Default Argument
  o  Direct Access to Dbm(3) Files
  o  Batched SMTP Support
  o  Separate Envelope/Header Rewriting Rulesets
  o  Separate Local UUCP Host Name
  o  Return Path for UUCP Mailers
  o  UUCP Header Address Relativization
  o  Support for Multi-Token Matches
  o  Support for Embedded Subruleset Calls
  o  Elaborate Matching Algorithm for Unknown Local Recipients
  o  Support for Maryland's Mdbm Package
  o  Improved Test Mode Output
  o  Better To: and Cc: Headers of Returned Messages

It also comes with the IDA Configuration Kit, which has pathalias based
systems routing within sendmail, fully !-/@-translating rulesets,
generic localuser addresses, and more.

Enjoy!
