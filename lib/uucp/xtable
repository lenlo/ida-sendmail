#
#	Translation table between domain addresses and
#	flat-spaced UUCP node names.
#
#	This table is used when formatting addresses for
#	delivery overold-fashioned UUCP links.  Batched SMTP
#	over UUCP does not use this table, since it is assumed
#	that (B)SMTP nodes already know about domain names.
#
#	It is never necessary to enter a translation from "foo.UUCP"
#	to "foo", since that already (automatically) is done by
#	ruleset 14.
