# ida-sendmail

This is the IDA Sendmail Enhancement Kit (1.2.9) for sendmail v5.59 and is
the last version of the Kit that I released back in 1988. It is included
here mainly as a historical artifact as most of what this Kit provides was
eventually included upstream in the proper sendmail source.

To find out more about the Kit, please see the original README file.
